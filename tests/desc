Brief description about the tests:

  - tests/test_config.py exercises YAML parsing and duration helpers.
  - tests/test_feeds.py feeds a local RSS XML string through fetch_feed (with retry simulation) to
    ensure parsing works without network access.
  - tests/test_filter.py checks keyword/domain/tag filters plus recency limits.
  - tests/test_dedupe.py validates link/title dedup heuristics and stripping of tracking parameters.
  - tests/test_cluster.py keeps the lightweight clustering deterministic and threshold-aware.
  - tests/test_cache_integration.py ensures the pipeline respects the cache so repeated runs skip
    previously seen links.
  - tests/test_render.py covers timestamp formatting, color toggling, and limits on rendered items.
  - tests/test_summarize.py covers representative selection, local fallback summaries, and cache-aware
    pipeline runs.
  - tests/test_ollama_client.py mocks HTTP calls to guarantee the Ollama client handles success/error
    paths and emits the expected prompt outline.
  - tests/test_cli.py uses Typer’s runner with monkeypatched dependencies to confirm CLI commands wire
    up the pipeline and that debug/stats helpers behave.
